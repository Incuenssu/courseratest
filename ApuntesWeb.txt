Visit with the client
	General ideas:
		Most clients have NO IDEA what they want.
			It's YOUR JOB to ask questions to figure it out.
			Bring web site examples of similar businesses.
		Less (information) is more: If all is important, nothing is important.
			Encourage yout client not to cram information on the site.
		Find a way for the client to INVEST in the project.
			Especially true if you're doing this for free just to build up your portfolio.
				E.g., have them commit to pay for product photography.
		Have client designate ONE PERSON responsible for decisions.
		Limit number of revisions UPFRONT.
			If it's a paying job, limit number of FREE revisions.
		Google for "web development client questionnaire".
		Involve others if needed.
			Contact a local college and see if a graphic design student wants to join you bay providing free design services.
			Same for photography, if your site needs one.
		Get an idea of what the client has right now.
			Website, facebook, etc. for example on GoogleMaps.
